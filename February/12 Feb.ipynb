    "### an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, Python raises an instance of an exception class which contains information about the type of error that occurred and where it occurred in the code. The program can then catch and handle the exception to prevent the program from crashing or producing unexpected results.\n",

    "### The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur during the compilation or parsing phase of the program, while exceptions occur during the execution phase. Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed at all, while exceptions can occur during the execution of a program even if the syntax is correct. \n"

These exceptions are created by subclassing the built-in Exception class and adding any additional behavior or attributes that are needed. Custom exceptions are useful when you want to create your own error messages that are more meaningful to the end-user. By raising a custom exception, you can also provide more detailed information about the error, such as where it occurred and what caused it. "
