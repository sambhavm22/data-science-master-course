    "activeCount(): This function returns the number of currently active threads in the current process. This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the behavior of your program. For example, you might use activeCount() to determine whether you have too many threads running at once, which could cause performance issues.\n",

    "enumerate(): This function returns a list of all active Thread objects in the current process. Each Thread object represents a thread of execution. This can be useful for iterating over all of the threads in the program and performing some action on each one. For example, you might use enumerate() to check the status of all threads and terminate any threads that are no longer needed.\n",

    "run(): This method is called when a thread is started using the start() method. It contains the code that the thread will execute when it is running. When creating a custom thread class, you will typically override this method to define your thread's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "start(): This method starts the execution of a thread. When called, the run() method of the thread is executed in a separate thread of control. You can call the start() method only once per thread instance; if you try to call it again, a RuntimeError will be raised.\n",

    "join(): This method blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it is called completes its execution. When you call join() on a thread, the calling thread will wait until the target thread terminates.

You can specify a timeout value (in seconds) for join() to prevent it from blocking indefinitely.\n",

    "isAlive(): This method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the thread is still running. Specifically, it returns True if the thread is currently executing, and False otherwise.

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource. In other words, each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs, and neither thread can proceed until it acquires the resource that the other thread is holding. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve because they involve circular dependencies, which means that a cycle of waiting threads prevents any of the threads from proceeding. Deadlocks can occur when threads are not properly synchronized when accessing shared resources such as locks or semaphores.\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the behavior of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute. In other words, the output of the program is unpredictable because it depends on the relative timing of the threads. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable simultaneously, the result may be different depending on which thread completes the update first. Race conditions can lead to incorrect or inconsistent program behavior, and can be difficult to detect and reproduce because they depend on the timing of the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can be avoided by using proper synchronization techniques, such as locks, semaphores, or atomic operations, to coordinate access to shared resources. By ensuring that threads access shared resources in a mutually exclusive and coordinated manner, you can prevent deadlocks and race conditions from occurring, and ensure that your program behaves correctly and consistently.\n",
