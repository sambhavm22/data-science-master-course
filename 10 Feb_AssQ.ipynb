    "x (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to open a file exclusively for writing. If the file already exists, an error will occur.\n",

    "The with statement is used with the open() function in Python to ensure that a file is properly closed after it has been used. This is important because leaving a file open can consume system resources and cause problems with other programs that need to access the same file.\n",

When you use the with statement, Python creates a context in which the file is opened and the operations on the file are performed. Once the operations are complete, the file is automatically closed by Python, even if an error occurs during the processing of the file."
