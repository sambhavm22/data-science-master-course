    "### Answers: -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In order to predict house prices based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., for an SVM regression model, the best regression metric to employ would be Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, the more appropriate evaluation metric would be Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE penalizes larger errors more than R-squared, making it a suitable choice when the focus is on accurately predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you have a dataset with a significant number of outliers and are trying to select an appropriate regression metric for your SVM model, the most appropriate metric would be Median Absolute Error (MAE). MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics such as MSE or R-squared. It measures the median of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, making it more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you have built an SVM regression model using a polynomial kernel and both MSE and RMSE values are very close, it is advisable to choose RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the evaluation metric. RMSE provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the same unit as the target variable. It is widely used and easy to interpret, especially when the errors follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When comparing the performance of different SVM regression models using different kernels (linear, polynomial, and RBF), the most appropriate evaluation metric to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable would be R-squared (coefficient of determination). R-squared quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data and better explanation of the variance.\n"
