It constructs an affinity matrix based on pairwise similarities between data points and then performs Eigen-Decomposition on the affinity matrix to extract the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues. The resulting eigenvectors are used to embed the data points in a lower-dimensional space, where traditional clustering algorithms like k-means are applied. Spectral clustering is effective for discovering non-linear and complex structures in data, making it useful in image segmentation, social network analysis, and document clustering.\n",

    "3. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): LSA is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to uncover latent semantic relationships in textual data. It applies Eigen-Decomposition to a term-document matrix, where the matrix represents the frequencies of terms across documents. By decomposing the matrix, LSA identifies the latent topics (eigenvectors) and their importance (eigenvalues) in the corpus. LSA is used for tasks such as document classification, information retrieval, and text summarization.\n",

    "These applications highlight the versatility of the Eigen-Decomposition approach in data analysis and machine learning, offering powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and uncovering latent structures in various types of data.\n",
