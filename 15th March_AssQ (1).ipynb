    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. It refers to the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be classified into three types: narrow or weak AI, general or strong AI, and super AI. An example of AI is the voice-activated personal assistant Siri on an iPhone, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to interpret and respond to user requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of statistical techniques to enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves the use of labeled data to train a model, while unsupervised learning involves the use of unlabeled data to discover patterns or groupings. Reinforcement learning involves the use of rewards or punishments to encourage or discourage certain behaviors. An example of ML is a spam filter, which learns to identify and classify spam emails based on examples of spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves the use of artificial neural networks to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task. DL algorithms are particularly useful for handling complex and large-scale datasets, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The key difference between traditional ML algorithms and DL algorithms is that DL algorithms can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. An example of DL is a facial recognition system, which uses a deep neural network to analyze and identify features of a face and match them with known faces in a database.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying data points that do not fit within the normal patterns of a dataset. In other words, it can identify outliers in a dataset.
