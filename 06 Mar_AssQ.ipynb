    "Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with the summarization and description of data using numerical or graphical techniques. It involves describing the characteristics of a dataset in terms of central tendency, variability, and distribution. Descriptive statistics are useful for exploring and understanding the patterns and trends in data, and they can be used to summarize and present data in a clear and concise manner. Some common examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and histograms.\n",

It involves using statistical methods to draw conclusions about a population based on data from a sample, while accounting for uncertainty and variability in the data. Inferential statistics are useful for testing hypotheses, making predictions, and making decisions based on data. Some common examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis."
