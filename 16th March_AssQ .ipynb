    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of models. The main idea of regularization is to add a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have small weights and avoid overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common regularization techniques and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso): In L1 regularization, a penalty term is added to the loss function, which is proportional to the absolute value of the weights. L1 regularization encourages the model to have sparse weights and sets some of them to zero. This can be useful for feature selection and reducing the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge): In L2 regularization, a penalty term is added to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the weights. L2 regularization encourages the model to have small weights and prevents the model from overfitting by smoothing the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks. In dropout, some neurons in the network are randomly dropped out during training. This forces the network to learn more robust features and reduces the sensitivity to the noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents the model from memorizing the training data and helps to achieve better generalization performance.\n",
