    "Suppose a certain disease affects 1% of the population. A diagnostic test for the disease has a false positive rate of 5% (meaning it incorrectly identifies 5% of healthy people as having the disease) and a false negative rate of 2% (meaning it incorrectly identifies 2% of people with the disease as not having it). If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have it?\n",

    "A: the person has the disease\n",
    "B: the person tests positive for the disease\n",

    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",

    "First, we need to calculate the probability of evidence B given that event A has occurred (i.e., the true positive rate of the test). This is simply the complement of the false negative rate, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to calculate the prior probability of event A occurring, which is given in the problem as 0.01:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = 0.01\n",

    "Finally, we need to calculate the prior probability of evidence B occurring, which can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of true positive and false positive results:\n",
