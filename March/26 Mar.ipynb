The number of hours studied would be the independent variable, and the grade earned on the exam would be the dependent variable. The regression equation would predict the grade earned on the exam based on the number of hours studied.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to minimize the cost function of a model. The cost function measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable, and the goal of the optimization algorithm is to find the set of model parameters that minimizes this cost function.\n",

    "The basic idea of gradient descent is to iteratively adjust the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function, until the minimum is reached. This is done by calculating the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter and updating the parameters accordingly. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase in the cost function, and by taking its negative, we move in the direction of the steepest descent.\n",
