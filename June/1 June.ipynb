    "\n",
    "- Some activation functions, like Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU (PReLU), and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), address the \"dead neuron\" problem associated with ReLU. In ReLU, neurons with a negative input output zero and remain inactive, potentially causing them to stay inactive throughout training. Leaky ReLU and its variants allow a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs, preventing neurons from becoming entirely inactive.\n",

    "5. Impact on Generalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of activation function can influence the generalization capabilities of a neural network. Some activation functions, such as dropout or Gaussian noise injection, are used as regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",

    "- Activation functions can affect the speed at which a neural network converges during training. Activation functions with well-behaved gradients, like ReLU and its variants, often lead to faster convergence.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The sigmoid function maps its input \n",
    "\n",
    "2. x to an output in the range of [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For positive inputs, the sigmoid outputs values close to 1, and for negative inputs, it outputs values close to 0.\n",
    "The sigmoid function is S-shaped, with a smooth and continuous curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Output Range: One of the main advantages of the sigmoid function is that it squashes its input into the range [0, 1]. This makes it suitable for problems where you want to model probabilities or binary classification problems, where you need to predict probabilities of belonging to a class (e.g., logistic regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Smooth Gradient: The sigmoid function has a smooth derivative, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms like gradient descent. This smoothness allows for stable and continuous updates to the model's parameters during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vanishing Gradient: The sigmoid function is prone to the vanishing gradient problem. As the input moves away from zero (in the positive or negative direction), the derivative of the sigmoid becomes very small. When backpropagating gradients through deep networks, this can lead to extremely small gradient values, which slow down training or make it difficult for deep networks to learn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Not Centered on Zero: The sigmoid function is not centered around zero. This means that the output of the function is always positive, which can lead to issues in networks with symmetric weights. It can result in the \"zigzagging\" of gradients and slow convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output Saturation: The sigmoid function saturates when its input is very positive or very negative. This means that the gradients in these regions are close to zero. When the network's weights are updated during training, little information flows backward through layers, making it harder for the network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Output is Not Zero-Centered: The sigmoid function outputs values in the range [0, 1], but the output is not zero-centered. This lack of zero-centering can be problematic when used as an activation function in deep networks, potentially leading to suboptimal convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its disadvantages, the sigmoid activation function has largely been replaced by other activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants, which are better suited for training deep neural networks. ReLU addresses some of the shortcomings of sigmoid, such as the vanishing gradient problem, and has become the default choice for many neural network architectures. However, sigmoid is still occasionally used in specific situations, such as binary classification problems and certain recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures."

    "\n",
    "1. Output Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary difference between ReLU and the sigmoid function is in their output ranges. ReLU produces output values in the range [0, ∞), meaning it is unbounded on the positive side. In contrast, the sigmoid function maps inputs to the range (0, 1), which is bounded between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- While both ReLU and sigmoid introduce non-linearity into the neural network, ReLU is more powerful in this regard. ReLU applies a simple thresholding operation, introducing a piecewise linear non-linearity. The sigmoid function, while non-linear, has a more gradual transition between its two extremes (0 and 1), which can limit its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vanishing Gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the major advantages of ReLU over the sigmoid function is its mitigation of the vanishing gradient problem. In the sigmoid function, the gradient approaches zero for large positive and negative inputs, which can slow down training in deep networks. ReLU has a constant gradient of 1 for positive inputs, making it more robust to vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Computation Efficiency:\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Sparsity:\n",

    "- ReLU introduces sparsity in neural networks because it sets negative values to zero. This sparsity can lead to more efficient representations and faster training. However, it can also cause issues like \"dying ReLU\" units that never activate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Choice of Output Units:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReLU is often used in hidden layers of neural networks, especially in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feedforward neural networks. Sigmoid is typically used in the output layer when the task involves binary classification or when you want to model probabilities.\n",

    "- The primary advantage of Leaky ReLU over the standard ReLU is its ability to address the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
